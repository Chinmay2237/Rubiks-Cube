<p> <h2>Who we are</h2>
The Rubiks Cube Association governs competitions for mechanical puzzles that are operated by twisting groups of pieces, commonly known as 'twisty puzzles'. The most famous of these puzzles is the Rubik's Cube, invented by professor Rubik from Hungary. A selection of these puzzles are chosen as official events of the RCA.

As the RCA has evolved over the past decade, over 100,000 people have competed in our competitions. Despite this growth, we remain an organization that is entirely run by volunteers, from local organizers to RCA Delegates to even the RCA Board. We are very grateful to everyone who takes time out of their lives to allow the RCA to function. With more financial support, we hope to bring an even greater level of professionalism to our competitions as we continue to sanction more events across the globe.


 <h2> What's next for the RCA? </h2>
The Rubiks Cube Association has had over 100,000 unique competitors across 140 different countries and we are not planning on slowing down anytime soon! The cubing community has been growing steadily since our founding in 2004 and we want to encourage this to continue into the future by increasing the accessibility of competitions to new areas. In the future, we hope to support our community even more through collaborations and outreach to those who care about puzzles.

 <h2> World Championship</h2>
Every two years, we sanction the competition that ultimately determines the world champion. These events require extremely careful planning by a number of volunteers, as well as a large financial commitment to reserve the venue and make necessary preparations.
